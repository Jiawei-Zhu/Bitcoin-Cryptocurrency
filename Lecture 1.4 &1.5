Lecture 1.4
Public key as identities

-useful trick: public key == an indentity

-if you see sig such that verfy(pk,msg,sig)==true, think of it as
pk says, "[msg]" (to "speak for" pk, you must know matching secret key sk

-how to make a new indentity
create a new, random key-pair(sk,pk)
  pk is the public 'name' you can use
  [usually better to use Hash(pk)]
  sk lets you 'speak for' the indentity
you control the indentity, because only you know sk if pk "looks random",
nobody needs to know who you are

-privacy
addrsses not directly connected to real-world identity
but observer can link together an address's activity over time, make inferences.
