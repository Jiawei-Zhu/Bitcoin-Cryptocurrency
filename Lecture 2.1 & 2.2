Lecture 2.1
Centralization vs Decentralization

-almost no system is PURELY decentralized or PURELY centralized

-Aspects of decentralization in Bitcoin
Peer-to-peer network:
    open to anyone, low barrier to entry
Mining:
    open to anyone, but inevitable concentration of power
    often seen as undesirable
Updates to software:
    core developers trusted by community, have great power


Lecture 2.2
Distributed Consensus

-Bitcoin’s key challenge: distributed consensus(分布式一致性)

-how consensus could work in Bitcoin
at any given time:
·All nodes have a sequence of blocks of transactions they've reached consensus on
·Each node has a set of outstanding transactions it's heard about

-why consensus is hard
·Nodes may crash
·Nodes may be malicious

Network is imperfect
·Not all pairs of nodes connected
·Faults in network
·Latency(延迟: no notion of global time

-Understanding impossibility results(理解那些认为分布一致性不可能的结论
these results say more about the model than about the problem
the models were developed to study systems like distributed databases

-Some things Bitcoin does differently
Introduces incentives(引入激励机制
·Possible only because it's a currency!
Embraces randomness
·Does away with the notion of a specific end-point
·Consensus happens over long time scales - about 1 hour

·Bitcoin doesn’t quite solve the distributed consensus problem in a general sense.
But it solves it in the context of the currency system.
