Lecture 2.4
Incentives and proof of work

-Assumption of honesty is problematic
Everything so far is just a distributed consensus protocol. 
But now we utilize the fact that the currency has value.

-Incentive 1: block reward
Creator of blocks gets to
·include special coin-creation transaction in the block(coinbase
·choose recipient address of this transaction

-Value is fixed: currently 25 BTC, halves every 4 years
Block creator gets to 'collect' the reward only if the block ends up on long-term consensus branch!

-Incentive 2: transaction fees
Creator of transaction can choose to make output value less than input value
Remainder is a transaction fee and goes to block creator
Purely voluntary, like a tip

-Hash puzzles
To create block, find nonce s.t.
H(nonce||prev_hash||tx||...||tx) is very small
If hash function is secure: only way to succeed is to try enough nonces until you get lucky

-PoW property 1:
Difficult to compute

-PoW property 2: vparameterizable(可参数化) cost
Nodes automatically re-calculate the target every 2 weeks
Goal: average time between blocks = 10 mins
Prob(Alice wins next block) = fraction of global hash power she controls
Key security assumption:
Attacks infeasible if majority of miners weighted by hash power follow the protocol

-PoW property 3: trivial to verify
Nonce must be published as part of block
Other miners simply verify that H(nonce||prev_hash||tx||...||tx) < target


Lecture 2.5
Putting it all together

-What can a "51% attacker" do?
Steal coins from existing address?    -no
Suppress some transactions?
· From the blockchain   -ok
· From the P2P network   -no
Destroy confidence in Bitcoin?    -ok
