Hash Pointers and Data Structures

-Hash pointer is:
*pointer to where some info is stored, and
*(cryptographic)hash of the info

-If we have a hash pointer, we can
*ask to get the info back, and
*verify that it hasn't changed

-Key idea: bulid data structures with hash pointers

-Use case: tamper-evident(防篡改) log

-A hash pointer tells us where something is and what its value was.

-binary tree with hash pointers = "Merkle tree"
it takes log n time to verify it

-advantages of Merkle trees
Tree holds many items but just need to remember the root hash
Can verify membership in O(log n) time/space
