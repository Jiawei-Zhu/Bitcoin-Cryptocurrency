Consensus without Identity: the Blockchain

-We should keep in mind that Bitcoin does all of this without nodes having any persistent long-term identities.
This is a difference from how traditional distributive consensus.

-In general, the more confirmations your transaction gets the higher the probability that it is going 
to end up on the long-term consensus chain.

-Double-spend probability decreases exponentially with # of confirmations
most common heuristic: 6 confirmations

-Protection against invalid transactions is cryptographic, but enforced by consensus

-Protection against double-spending is purely by consensus

-You're never 100% sure a transaction is in consensus branch. 
Guarantee is probabilistic
