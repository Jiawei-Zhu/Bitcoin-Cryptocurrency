Cryptographic hash functions

Hash property 1 Collision Free

-Collisions do exist, but NOBODY can find.

-How to find a collision?
(try pow(2,130) randomly chosen inputs
99.8% chance that two of them will collide..)
This works no matter what H is...
but it takes too long to matter

-There’s no hash function in existence which has been proven to be collision free. 
There just some that people have tried really hard to find collisions and haven’t succeeded. 
And so we choose to believe that those are collision free.

-We can use hash function as Message Digest. If we know that x and y have the same hash, 
then it’s safe to assume that x and y are the same.(e.g. Big File) 
It gives us a very efficient way to remember things we’ve seen before and recognize them again.

Hash property 2 Hiding
